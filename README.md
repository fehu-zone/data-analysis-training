# Introduction to Data Science and Key Concepts

## What is Data Science?
- The roles and responsibilities of data scientists and data analysts.
- The workflow of a data scientist: problem definition, data collection, analysis, and reporting.

## Datasets and Types of Data
- Numerical, categorical, ordinal, and nominal data types.
- Structured and unstructured data.

## Using Fundamental Libraries like Pandas and NumPy
- Data manipulation and dataframe operations.
- Numerical operations with NumPy.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning Techniques

### Handling Missing Data
- Detecting and managing missing data (deletion, filling, interpolation).

### Data Transformation and Normalization
- Transforming numerical and categorical variables, scaling.

### Outlier Analysis
- Detecting outliers (IQR, Z-score methods).
- Strategies for managing outliers.

## Feature Selection and Feature Engineering
- Identifying important features, eliminating unnecessary features.
- Creating new features through feature engineering.

## Statistical Tests and Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics
- Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation.
- Measures of distribution: skewness, kurtosis.

### Hypothesis Testing and P-value
- What is hypothesis testing? How to interpret the p-value?
- Z-test, T-test, ANOVA (F-test).

### Correlation Tests
- Pearson correlation coefficient.
- Spearman’s rank correlation.
- Kendall tau correlation.

### Chi-square Test
- What is the chi-square test? When is it used?
- Testing relationships between categorical variables.

### F-Test and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- The purpose of the F-test, examining variance differences between two groups.
- Comparing the means of multiple groups using ANOVA.

## Code Examples
- Applications of hypothesis tests and statistical tests (t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Examining Data Distributions
- Data visualization: histograms, box plots, scatter plots.

### Data Visualization Techniques
- Visualizing data with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

### Correlation Analysis and Heatmaps
- Correlation coefficients and using heatmaps.

### Code Examples
- Correlation matrix and data visualization (scatter plot, histogram).

## Introduction to Regression Analysis

### Simple Linear Regression
- Dependent and independent variables.
- The theoretical basis of linear regression and linear relationships.
- Building a model with Scikit-learn.

### Multiple Linear Regression
- Regression analysis with multiple variables.
- Code example: Making predictions with multiple regression.

### Polynomial Regression
- The theoretical basis of polynomial regression, curve fitting.
- Code examples: Predicting prices with polynomial regression.

## Logistic Regression and Classification Algorithms

### Logistic Regression
- Classification problem, the logic of logistic regression, and the sigmoid function.
- Code examples: Building a logistic regression model with Scikit-learn.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- SVM theory, decision boundaries, and kernel methods.
